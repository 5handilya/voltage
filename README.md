# VOLTAGE 
*a SIMD-accelerated BLAS library*

## Overview
1. implement SIMD-leveraging functions required for neural net backprop and inference
2. package as a header library
3. publish

###  1. Functions to be implemented
~~1. vector-vector dot product~~
~~2. vector scaling~~
~~3 matrix-vector multiplication~~
~~4 matrix-matrix multiplication~~
### 2. Header packaging and optimization
1. Refactor - unified
2. Error handling
3. General debugging and logging ad
4. Benchmarking and optimization (compare to which libs??)
### 3. Publish
1. Write documentation
2. ???
3. Happy
