# VOLTAGE 
*a SIMD-accelerated C++ BLAS*

## Overview
1. implement SIMD-leveraging functions required for neural net backprop and inference
2. package as a header library
3. publish

###  1. Functions to be implemented

~~vector-vector dot product~~

~~- vector scaling~~

~~- matrix-vector multiplication~~

~~- matrix-matrix multiplication~~

### 2. Header packaging and optimization

I. Refactor - unified 
II. Error handling
III. General debugging and logging add
IV. Benchmarking and optimization 
compare to which libs??

### 3. Publish

I. Write documentation

II. ??
