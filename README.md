# VOLTAGE 
*a SIMD-accelerated C++ BLAS*

## Overview
1. implement SIMD-leveraging functions required for neural net backprop and inference
2. package as a header library
3. publish

###  1. Functions to be implemented

~~1.1 vector-vector dot product~~

~~1.2 vector scaling~~

~~1.3 matrix-vector multiplication~~

~~1.4 matrix-matrix multiplication~~

### 2. Header packaging and optimization

1. Refactor - unified
2. Error handling
3. General debugging and logging ad
4. Benchmarking and optimization (compare to which libs??)

### 3. Publish

3.1 Write documentation

3.2 ??
