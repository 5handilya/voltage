# VOLTAGE
# C++ BLAS

## Overview
1. implement SIMD-leveraging functions required for neural net backprop and inference
2. package as a header library

###  1. Functions to be implemented
I. Vector - Vector
~~- dot product ~~
II. Vector - Scalar
~~- SV multiplication~~
III. Matrix - Vector
- MV multiplication
IV. Matrix - Matrix
- MM multiplication

### 2. Header packaging
