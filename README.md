# VOLTAGE 
*a SIMD-accelerated C++ BLAS*

## Overview
1. implement SIMD-leveraging functions required for neural net backprop and inference
2. package as a header library
3. publish

~~###  1. Functions to be implemented~~

I. Vector - Vector

~~- dot product ~~

II. Vector - Scalar

~~- SV multiplication~~

III. Matrix - Vector

~~- MV multiplication~~

IV. Matrix - Matrix

~~- MM multiplication~~

### 2. Header packaging and optimization

I. Refactor - unified 

II. Error handling

III. General debugging and logging add

IV. Benchmarking and optimization 
        compare to which libs??

### 3. Publish

I. Write documentation

II. ??
